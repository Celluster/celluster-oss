**Definitions.** “Contribution” means any code, documentation, data, or other material you submit to the Project via pull request, issue, patch, or otherwise. “Project” means the Celluster Open Source Project and its maintainers.

**1. Copyright License.** You grant the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non‑exclusive, irrevocable, royalty‑free license to use, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions, in source and object form, under any license(s) the Project may use now or in the future (including open source and commercial licenses).

**2. Patent License.** You acknowledge that **patent rights are separately governed** by the Project’s [PATENT_NOTICE.md](./PATENT_NOTICE.md). Nothing in this ICLA grants any patent license beyond what is explicitly stated in that notice.    

You grant the Project and its users a perpetual, worldwide, non‑exclusive, irrevocable (except as stated here), royalty‑free patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer your Contributions, where such license applies only to patent claims you own or control that would be infringed by your Contribution alone or by combination of your Contribution with the Project. If you initiate patent litigation alleging that the Project or a Contribution infringes a patent, your patent licenses granted under this ICLA terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

**3. Eligibility & Rights.** You represent that each Contribution is your original work or that you have sufficient rights to grant the licenses above. You also represent that your Contribution does not knowingly include third‑party code or data under terms that conflict with the Project’s licenses.

**4.  Originality.** You represent that each Contribution is **your original work** or that you have the necessary rights to submit it. If your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have received permission to make the Contribution on their behalf.

**5. No Confidential/Implementation Material.** You agree **not to include confidential information or implementation details** (including code, pseudo-code, or reverse engineering of patented concepts) until the Project explicitly opens code contributions.

**6. Attribution.** You consent to your name and contribution metadata being used in Project records and notices.

**7. No Warranties.** Your Contribution is provided “AS IS”.

**8. No Assignment.** This ICLA is a **license grant only**; you retain ownership in your Contributions.

**9. Notices.** You agree to identify any third‑party components included in your Contributions and to follow any attribution or notice requirements of their licenses.

**10. Disclaimer.** Contributions are provided “as is” without warranties of any kind. The Project disclaims all implied warranties to the maximum extent permitted by law.

**11. Governing Law.** This ICLA is governed by the laws applicable in your place of residence unless otherwise required by local law.

**12. Entire Agreement.** This ICLA is the entire agreement with respect to your documentation-only Contributions, and may be updated by the Project; continued contributions imply acceptance of updates.

**Acceptance.** By submitting the Google Form or otherwise indicating acceptance, you agree to be bound by this ICLA for all past and future Contributions to the Project.
