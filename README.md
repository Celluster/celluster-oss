# Celluster (OSS Preview)

**Category:** **Reflex-Native Infrastructure** — intent-driven execution **without orchestration**  
A next-generation compute substrate where workloads launch, adapt, and secure themselves based on **intent** and **real-time telemetry** — not control planes.  
**No VMs. No containers. No Kubernetes.** Built on QUIC + eBPF with identity-bound execution.

> Celluster is the **origin and home of Reflex Compute**. You are early.

## Why Celluster
Traditional compute is built around orchestration, scheduling, and control. Celluster is built around **reflex**:
- **Intent-first execution** → move from YAML to semantic intent
- **Distributed decision flow** → eliminate orchestration overhead
- **Identity-bound transport** → trust tied to execution flow
- **State continuity & reuse** → warm execution without cold starts
- **Telemetry-driven adaptation** → reflexive, self-correcting systems
