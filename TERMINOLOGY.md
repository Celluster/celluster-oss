# Terminology â€“ Reflex Compute (Celluster)

This document defines the core terminology used in the Celluster project and the
emerging category of **Reflex-Native Infrastructure**. These terms describe
high-level concepts only and do **not** reveal implementation details.

---
>  This glossary is *conceptual only*. It does **not** expose implementation detail or patent logic.

## Core Concepts

### Reflex Compute
A compute model where **workloads launch, adapt, and secure themselves based on
intent and real-time telemetry** instead of orchestration or centralized control.
This is the foundation of Celluster.

### Intent
A declarative expression of *purpose* that drives runtime behavior. Unlike
traditional scheduling, **intent describes outcome**, not placement.

### Telemetry Feedback
Live system signals used by reflex logic to make real-time adjustments based on
resource pressure, performance, trust, and workload lineage.

---

## Runtime Primitives

### Reflex Cell
A secure, portable **execution unit** that maintains continuity across invocations.
Cells carry identity, peer trust, and behavioral context.

### Reflex Membrane
A lightweight **isolation + propagation boundary** that enables secure interaction
between Cells across nodes, GPUs, and trust zones.

### Reflex Engine
A **distributed coordination layer** that interprets intent and telemetry to drive
reflex behavior across Cells.

### ðŸ”¹ Reflex Fabric
A distributed substrate that connects cells across nodes and clusters with **secure identity-bound transport**.  
It propagates **state continuity and execution lineage** across machines without centralized orchestration.

## System Model

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Reflex Substrate | Execution fabric that enables distributed operation without schedulers |
| Reflex Graph | Dynamic relationship map between Cells during execution |
| Reflex Lineage | Historical continuity of a workload across evolutions/restarts |
| State Continuity | Ability to retain execution context without full restart |
| Identity-Bound Transport | Trust enforced at runtime via cryptographic binding |

## Reflex Verbs (Behavioral Model)

Reflex verbs describe **how workloads evolve at runtime**. These are high-level
behavioral expressions used in Celluster:

| Verb | Meaning (High-Level) |
|------|----------------------|
| `spawn` | Launch new Cell based on intent |
| `reroute` | Redirect execution path dynamically |
| `clone` | Create peer execution for parallelism or resilience |
| `upgrade` | Evolve workload behavior safely |
| `migrate` | Shift execution to new resource locality |
| `decay` | Retire or reduce footprint |
| `inspect` | Observe state safely without compromise |

These verbs are **conceptual, not implementation**. Full logic remains sealed
until the non-provisional patent is filed.

## Category Position

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Reflex-Native Infrastructure | New compute category defined by Celluster |
| Zero-Orchestration Compute | Execution without external control planes |
| Intent Fabric | Distributed decision flow driven by outcome over placement |
| Reflex AI Runtime | Reflex behavior applied to GPU + AI systems |

---

## Core Concepts Summary

Conceptual overview only â€” implementation details are intentionally withheld.

| Term | Meaning (High-Level) |
|------|----------------------|
| **Reflex Cell** | Minimal execution unit that reacts to **intent + telemetry** instead of orchestration commands |
| **Reflex Engine** | Distributed decision layer that enables local, autonomous reactions at microsecond speed |
| **Reflex Fabric** | Mesh of cooperating reflex cells exchanging state + signals across nodes |
| **Reflex Verbs** | Primitive lifecycle actions (e.g., spawn, reroute, clone, upgrade, decay) used to express execution behavior |
| **Reflex compute** | A new execution model where compute flows **react to conditions in real time**.  Workloads evolve based on **intent + telemetry**, not YAML or scheduling policies.|

> **Note**: This section introduces **concepts only**. It does **not** expose implementation, state management, reuse logic, or scaling architecture. See **[PATENT_NOTICE.md](./PATENT_NOTICE.md)** for IP protection.

### Legal Notice
These terms are part of **U.S. Provisional Patent 63/899,556** and associated
continuations. They are defined for clarity only and do not grant license,
rights, or implementation permission. See **PATENT_NOTICE.md**.
