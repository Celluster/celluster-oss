## FAQ

**Do I give up my copyright?** No. You license your work; you don’t assign ownership.  
**Can my company sign once for employees?** Yes (Corporate CLA support is planned; contact us).  
**Why have a CLA if the repo is Apache‑2.0 already?** The CLA ensures the project can legally **use and relicense** Contributions in the future (e.g., dual‑licensing, commercial distribution), and provides a **patent grant**.
