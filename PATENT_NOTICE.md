### Technical Scope and Distinctions

- **NUMA Locality**: Reflex Cells optimize memory affinity and CPU socket placement for predictable performance.  
- **GPU Cluster Mesh**: Reflex membranes coordinate GPU binding and interconnect topology across multi‑GPU nodes.  
- **AI Workload Reflex**: Intent‑bound execution replaces orchestration layers for inference and training pipelines.  
- **Reflex Verbs**: Primitives such as reroute, clone, decay, and upgrade dynamically reshape execution in real time.
