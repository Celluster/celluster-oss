# PATENT_NOTICE.md

This repository contains code, design artifacts, and semantic coordination logic covered under:

**U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 63/899,556**  
Filed: **October 15, 2025**  
Inventor: **Nikhil Sharma**  
Title: *Intent-Based Reflex Cell Architecture for AI-Native Infrastructure*
Status: Patent Pending

A full non-provisional patent is in preparation. Additional claims are forthcoming to expand coverage to scheduling, scaling, distributed execution contexts, and secure state continuity.

The invention introduces Reflex Cells ‚Äî a compute substrate that eliminates orchestration cold-start delays by intelligently reusing execution context.

It reimagines next-gen cloud for the AI era: no VMs, no containers, no Kubernetes.  
Workloads launch, adapt, and secure themselves based on intent and real-time telemetry.

Built from first principles using QUIC + eBPF with identity-bound transport, Reflex Compute is designed for microsecond decisions, GPU locality, and bare-metal performance ‚Äî all without control-plane overhead.

These elements are protected under U.S. patent law.

This notice is provided for informational purposes only and does not grant any license, express or implied, to the patented material.

### üõ°Ô∏è Patent Scope (High-Level)

The Celluster patent protects systems that:

- Launch or manage compute **based on intent rather than orchestration**
- Use **adaptive runtime behavior** driven by system or workload feedback
- **Eliminate centralized schedulers** via distributed decision flows
- Enable **state reuse and continuity across executions**
- Maintain **secure, identity-bound execution and propagation**
- Use **telemetry or signal-based self-management in compute flows**

The scope of protection is defined solely by the claims of the filed patent application and any future continuation filings.

> **NOTICE ‚Äì Patent Coverage Includes Equivalents**  
> Re-implementing these behaviors using different terminology, code structure, or technology stacks **may still constitute infringement** if the resulting system performs **substantially the same function in the same way with the same results** (Doctrine of Equivalents, U.S. Patent Law).

### üö´ No Unauthorized Use

This repository is provided for **conceptual exploration only**.  
No license is granted to build, implement, simulate, deploy, commercialize, or derive competing systems based on any concepts described herein.

Any commercial, research, or derivative use requires **explicit written authorization** from the author.

This clause does not override contributor rights granted via signed ICLA.  
It applies to non-contributor use of conceptual materials.

Nothing in this repository, including any files, discussions, or diagrams, shall be interpreted as a public license, open-source grant, or waiver of patent rights

### Conceptual Scope & Vision (Non-Limiting)
The following concepts illustrate high-level vision themes and are non-limiting. They do not represent full claim language or implementation specifics.

- **NUMA Locality**: Reflex Cells optimize memory affinity and CPU socket placement for predictable performance.  
- **GPU Cluster Mesh**: Reflex membranes coordinate GPU binding and interconnect topology across multi‚ÄëGPU nodes.  
- **AI Workload Reflex**: Intent‚Äëbound execution replaces orchestration layers for inference and training pipelines.  
- **Reflex Verbs**: Primitives such as reroute, clone, decay, and upgrade dynamically reshape execution in real time.
